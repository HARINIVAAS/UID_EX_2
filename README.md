# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

DESCRIPTION:

A Card Component in React is a reusable UI component that is typically used to present a block of content in an organized and visually appealing way. It often contains elements like a header (title), body (content), and footer (actions). The Card Component can include elements such as images, text, buttons, icons, or links, making it flexible for various use cases like user profiles, product listings, articles, and more.

Image or Avatar (optional):

Displays an image or avatar, usually at the top, to visually represent the content of the card (e.g., user profile, product image, etc.).
Title or Header:

A title that summarizes the content of the card (e.g., name, product, or article title).
Description or Body Content:

A section that provides additional information. This could be a short bio, product details, article summary, or other text relevant to the card.
Actions (optional):

One or more action buttons (e.g., "Contact", "Read More", "Add to Cart") that allow the user to interact with the card. This is usually located at the bottom or below the main content.
Styling & Layout:

Cards typically have padding, shadow, and border-radius to give a clean, visually appealing look. The layout can vary depending on the cardâ€™s purpose, but it often follows a vertical or grid structure.
